Today's post will be all about data, a topic that is as important as ever, and I'm sure very much relevant to the work performed by the [minibuilders](/blog/embracing-the-minibuilder-mindset/) out there.

Specifically, we will dig into the first two steps of any data process:

1. **ðŸ‘€ Reading the data**, which consists in bringing data into our app/library, in a raw format.
2. **ðŸ§  Parsing the data**, which consists in transforming this raw data into something that can be understood and exploited.

Most apps and tools need to ingest data and parse it in some way. This includes the tools we covered in our [starter pack](/blog/your-python-starter-pack/), which **read** our code as text files, before **parsing** into a syntax tree, that then can be used to build insights into how the code is built.

We will start by looking at the most common place where we will find data: files, and then move on to some more specific parsing processes, which will be useful, albeit a bit more situational.

## Interacting with files

Via the `open` function, Python makes it very easy to interact with files, for both reading and writing.

This function requires, at the very least, the path to the file you're trying to open, as well as the mode you want to open it in. For reading, the modes are either `"rb"` to read the file as raw bytes , with no decoding, and `"rt"` (or simply `"r"`) to read the file as text, decoded using the encoder specified in the `encoder` argument, which is [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) by default.

<!-- {

<!-- The `open` function returns a "file object" that can be used to then read the data
</Caption>
} -->

Note the `f.close()` call in the above example. When you open a file, you are essentially locking those resources to the process that is currently running (i.e. your Python script). While Python is working hard to ensure that issues do not occur with your files, you may find yourself in one of the two following situations:

- If you open many files as part of your process, you may be stopped by your operating system, who has a limit in the number of files that can be opened concurrently.
- If your program crashes unexpectedly, you may lose your data.

In order to make it easy for you, the Python language gives you a handy-dandy context manager, which takes care of the cleanup once you're done with the file.

![](../../assets/parse_ctx.png)

<!-- {

<Caption>
The context manager takes care of closing the file when we exit the `with` block
</Caption>
} -->

If you've never seen a context manager before, this may seem like magic. But don't worry, they will be covered in a future post.

This is the barebones blueprint for working with files. Using this as a base, we are now going to go over the methods for reading and parsing files.

### Simple reading

If you want to simply read the file's contents, with no specific parsing (e.g. if the file only includes text), Â you can do so in a multitude of ways.

- `f.read(size)` reads a block of size `size` from the file. Doing so moves the pointer in the file, so that reading can be picked up at a later stage.

  ![](../../assets/parse_onechar.png)
  <!-- {
  <Caption>
  By reading character by character, we can stop when we read a certain character
  </Caption>
  } -->

- Omitting the `size` argument, thus calling `f.read()` will return the entire file's contents.

  ![](../../assets/parse_readfile.png)
  <!-- {
  <Caption>
  Reading a file has never been so easy
  </Caption>
  } -->

- `f.readline()` returns the next line from the file, including the `\n` character.

  ![](../../assets/parse_readline.png)
  <!-- {
  <Caption>
  Since the `\n` is included in the line being printed, we set `end=""` in the `print` function
  </Caption>
  } -->

- `f.readlines()` returns all of the lines within the file into an iterator.

  ![](../../assets/parse_readlines.png)
  <!-- {
  <Caption>
  We use `enumerate` here to use the line number as well as its contents
  </Caption>
  } -->

### Parsing structured data from files

The files we use in our Python work are usually built with some kind of structure which gives meaning to the data. In this section, we will see the many ways Python makes it easy for us to read and parse structured data from files, including configuration files, but also more general data storage files, including tabular data.

##### .toml and .ini files

Consider the `pyproject.toml` file, which we have creating using the `poetry` package in our [previous post](/blog/your-python-starter-pack-part-2/).

![](../../assets/parse_poetry.png)

<!-- {

<Caption>
The file created by `poetry`
</Caption>
} -->

We would like to read the contents of this file and store it in some kind of dictionary, which will allow us to access its contents programmatically. Whenever such a task needs to be accomplished, you will have two ways to act:

1. I will look whether an implementation of such a parser already exists, either in the Python standard library, or in a trusted third party library; or
2. I will implement my own parser, because other implementations do not suit my needs.

As I'm sure you've guessed, the first method is preferable when it is suitable, as it will save us time and headaches in the future. I present below a very crude implementation of the parsing task below.

![](../../assets/parse_manual.png)

<!-- {

<Caption>
Not a great implementation
</Caption>
} -->

As you can see, it takes quite a few lines of code, and I cannot possibly be sure that I've covered every single edge case, as doing so would require me to dig into the `.toml` documentation. It works well in this specific example, but might break in the future.

The alternative would be to use the [`tomli`](https://pypi.org/project/tomli/) package, which is a third party package that will be integrated into the standard library (and renamed to `tomllib`) in Python 3.11.

![](../../assets/parse_tomli.png)

<!-- {

<Caption>
`tomli` makes this parsing task very easy
</Caption>
} -->

In this case, we only have to open the file in binary mode (this is a `tomli` requirement), and call the `load` function on our open file. You will notice that it has split the subsections of the `tool` section in the resulting dictionary, which was not included in our shoddy implementation above.

If you want to process .ini files, the standard library includes a module called `configparser`, which is built to do just that. For more details, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html).

#### .yaml and .json

Other commonly used file formats are .yaml and .json, which are used to store structured data. The more astute among you will remember that the configuration file for the `pre-commit` tool is a .yaml file.

To parse these files, we use two libraries that provide a similar API as `tomli`: the aptly named `json` and `PyYAML`.

Consider the two following equivalent .yaml and .json files.

![](../../assets/parse_yaml_json.png)

<!-- {

<Caption>
The same file structure, in .yaml and in .json
</Caption>
} -->

I personally like .yaml better when it comes to files that I need to manually write, as it is much more readable, since you don't need to deal with nested brackets all that much. If I need for my application to write some data to disk that I will not need to read myself, then I usually choose .json, as the parsing can be faster.

To parse them, we use the same "recipe" as we did with .toml, i.e.

![](../../assets/parse_libs.png)

<!-- {

<Caption>

</Caption>
} -->

See? Couldn't be easier!

#### Tabular data files

When dealing with tabular data files, I recommend that you leverage the library you would use to then exploit that data to parse it. In Python, we use `pandas` for this purpose.

`pandas`, as part of its huge set of functionalities, allows you to parse a large number of data files, including some of the formats we've already talked about, like .json.

To see the full list of functions, please refer to the [official documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#io-tools-text-csv-hdf5).

## Interacting with web pages

If you want to retrieve the contents of a webpage, you first read it using the `requests` module. To install it into your `poetry` environment, if you are using it, simply run `$ poetry add requests`.

Let's retrieve the contents of our [last blog post](/blog/your-python-starter-pack-part-2/) for example.

![](../../assets/parse_requests.png)

<!-- {

} -->

But as you can imagine, having it in text format is not very helpful. Parsing html can be a bit tricky because of the highly nested structures that can happen in webpage elements, and we therefore need a specialized library for parsing.

**[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to the rescue!** To install this powerful, yet funnily named library, run the following command `$ poetry add beautifulsoup4` if you use `poetry`, or `$ pip install beautifulsoup4` otherwise.

BeautifulSoup allows you to find [html tags](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.asp) within the tree-like structure of the webpage. These tags can be found based on either the tag itself (e.g. `<a>` for hyperlinks), or any attribute of the tag (e.g. styling attributes, the class name, etc.).

![](../../assets/parse_bs4.png)

<!-- {

<Caption>
A very simple use of the BeautifulSoup package
</Caption>
} -->

To illustrate the use of this package, let's try to retrieve all of the titles in the blog post. Titles are indicated by so-called `h` tags, ranging from `<h1>` for majort titles to `<h6>` for the smallest titles. Since we are only interested in the titles within the article, we limit ourselves to those found within the children of the `<article>` tag.

This can be super useful for retrieving information that is stored within the html of a page. Web pages that display content via JavaScript cannot be "scraped" that way. For those, look into the `selenium` package.

Scraping is not allowed by all websites, so be wary about automating data retrieval tasks on websites you do not own. To ensure that you are not overreaching, please check the website's Terms of Service, as well as the `robots.txt` file, by accessing `www.website.com/robots.txt` via your web browser.

## Reading machine-readable .pdfs

Often, you may have to automate a process which needs to retrieve some kind of data from a machine-readable .pdf (think any pdf where you can select and copy the text therein).

Say you receive a report from a service everyday, in pdf format, from which you need to retrieve a single data point, that is easily to locate on the page. If getting a data file like those we previously mentioned is not feasible, you can try to extract it directly from these .pdf files.

To read these .pdf files, you can use the `PyPDF2` library. See the example below for the extraction of all the text from a pre-publication paper.

![](../../assets/parse_pdf.png)

<!-- {

<Caption>
In just a few lines of code, we have extracted all of the text from the .pdf file
</Caption>
} -->

For more on the features of the package, head over to the [official documentation](https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Reading images containing text

Sometimes, you may need to retrieve data from image-based .pdfs, e.g. built from scanned documents, or from images of text. In such a situation, you do not have a choice but to turn to Optical Character Recognition ("OCR").

OCR is a vast domain that requires a lot of knowledge, so I will not dig too deep in this post, but I invite you to find some installation steps as well as an example of use below. We are going to use [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/), which is a humongous OCR engine developed by Google, but that is luckily not too hard to use for simple tasks.

Start by installing the `tesseract` engine using the [install guide](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html). On Ubuntu, you can simply install it from `apt` by running `$ sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`. Then, you need to install the `opencv` package for pre-processing your images, and `pytesseract` so that you can run `tesseract` via Python. If you use `poetry`, you can simply run `$ poetry add python-opencv pytesseract`.

The simplest pipeline can be found in the image below. It is simple because the text was high enough quality that I did not need to pre-process the image to make `tesseract`'s life easier.

![](../../assets/parse_ocr.png)

Wait, Python can read books for me?
</Caption>
} -->

As you can see, the result is quite good, with an issue in the first word, most likely due to distortion. Again, this is a bit of a cherrypicked example, but I hope it's done its job in illustrating that retrieving such data is actually possible in Python.

## Conclusion

I have seen many people in the past assume that some tasks are "un-automatable" (is that even a word?), simply because they did not know that parsing incoming data was possible (e.g. pdf data). But it is only once you reject the notion of impossibility that you can provide truly great value through your automation. Thankfully, Python does not ask us to work hard very often in finding these solutions, thanks to all of the wonderful third-party packages out there.

I hope this post has shown you the breadth of what is possible, even it did not go particularily in depth into any specific process.
