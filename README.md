# Rewrite of my personal site

## First phase - Static Site Generation ("SSG")

Since my site does not really need a server for now, I plan to deploy a set of pages which will be deployed on a simple platform like Github Pages.

- [ ] Migrate blog posts in `.md` form;
- [ ] Should be able to render:
  - [ ] Code blocks;
  - [ ] Images directly in the repo;
  - [ ] Mermaid and/or Graphviz diagrams.

## Second phase - Server-Side Rendering ("SSR")

TBD
